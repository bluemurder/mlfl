Hedge fund risks: two stock scenario

A: predict +1% over mkt
betaA = 1.0

B: predict -1% below mkt
betaB = 2.0

So hedge fund manager will buy long $50 of A, and sell short -$50 of B.

If market will not move:
rA = betaA * rm + alphaA = alphaA = 1% = $0.5
rB = betaB * rm + alphaB = alphaB = 1% = $0.5

If market goes +10%?
rA = betaA * rm + alphaA = 10% + 1% = 11% = 5.5
rB = betaB * rm + alphaB = 20% - 1% = -19% = -9.5
