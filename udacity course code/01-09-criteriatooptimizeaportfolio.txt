Which criteria would be easiest to solve for, in order to make a portfolio optimization?
1- Cumulative return
2- Minimum volatility
3- Sharpe ratio

Cumulative return is the most trivial measure to use - simply investing all your money in the stock with maximum return (and none in others) would be your optimal portfolio, in this case.

Hence, it is the easiest to solve for. But probably not the best for risk mitigation.
