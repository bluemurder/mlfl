Computing Sharpe Ratio

First formula: ex ante Sharpe Ratio

S = E[Rp - Rf] / std[Rp - Rf]

where:
E -> Expectation
std -> Standard deviation
Rp = portfolio return
Rf = risk-free rate of return

Approximation using historical values:

S = mean(daily_rets - daily_rf) / std(daily_rets - daily_rf)

Daily_rf can be computed in three ways:
* LIBOR
* 3mo T-bill
* 0% (present positive interest of a bank)

Traditional shortcut: if a bank positive interest is 10% in a year, daily_rf can be summarized as:

daily_rf = sqrt_252(1.0 + 0.1) - 1

SO, if daily_rf is more than zero, S can be rewritten as:

S = mean(daily_rets - daily_rf) / std(daily_rets)
where:
daily_rf = sqrt_252(1.0 + annual_bank_positive_interest) - 1

Finally, S can be weighted according to our sample measure.

Sannual = K * S, where K = sqrt(# samples per year)
K = sqrt(252) for daily
K = sqrt(52) for weekly
K = sqrt(12) for monthly

S is conceived as an annual measure, so if sampling is on a daily basis, 

Sannual = sqrt(252) * mean(daily_rets - daily_rf) / std(daily_rets)

Example: given
60 days of data,
avg daily ret = 10bps = 0.001
daily risky free = 2 bps = 0.0002
std daily ret = 10 bps = 0.001

Sannualized = sqrt(252) * 0.0008 / 0.001 = 12.70

Now one can build a tool able to find automatically:
* Cumulative return
* Average daily return
* Risk (std of daily return)
* Sharpe Ratio
