Buy?
Yes, you should buy it right away!

Ignoring the intrinsic value, if you buy the entire company off the market (for $75M) and immediately sell it for its book value ($80M), you have a $5M profit right there!

Even if you are buying some stocks (instead of the whole company), the stock price is expected to increase (as it is currently undervalued).
